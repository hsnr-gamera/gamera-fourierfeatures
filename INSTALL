Installation instructions for teh Gamera FourierFeatures Toolkit
================================================================

Building and Installing
-----------------------

To build and install this toolkit on Linux or MacOS X, activate your virtual environment (where Gamera is installed), go to the base
directory of the toolkit distribution and run ::
	
	# activate the virtual environment
	source path/to/venv/bin/activate
   	# compile
	python3 setup.py build bdist_wheel
	# install
	pip3 install dist/gamera_fourierfeatures-*.whl
	
No root privileges are required. All components are installed locally inside the virtual environment.

If you want to use your virtual environment with Gamera globally, you can add its bin directory to your shellâ€™s PATH variable::

    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/venv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

To regenerate the documentation, go to the ``doc`` directory and run the
``gendoc.py`` script. The output will be placed in the ``doc/html/``
directory.  The contents of this directory can be placed on a webserver
for convenient viewing.

.. note:: Before building the documentation you must install the
   toolkit. Otherwise ``gendoc.py`` will not find the plugin documentation.

Uninstallation
--------------

On Linux, you can uninstall the FourierFeatures Toolkit as follows:

    # Activate the virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Uninstall the toolkit:
    pip3 uninstall gamera-fourierfeatures
