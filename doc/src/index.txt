==========================
Overview of the FD-toolkit
==========================

:Editor: Christian Brandt, Christoph Dalitz and Oskar Waedt

:Version: 2.0.0

Overview
''''''''

This toolkit implements the Fourier descriptors described in [Dalitz2013]_.
The number of coefficients (= feature dimension) used is controlled
by the variable ``FDLENGTH`` in ``gamera/toolkits/plugins/single.py`` and
``gamera/toolkits/plugins/broken.py``, which is evaluated at the compile
time of the toolkit. It defaults to 60. When changing it, make sure to
choose a multiple of 12.


All Fourier descriptors are provided as Gamera plugins in the category
"Features", so that they are immediately available after loading the
toolkit in Gamera. The features are distributed over two files: 
``single.py`` provides descriptors that only work on unbroken shapes,
and ``broken.py`` provides descriptors that work on broken shapes, too.

Documentation
'''''''''''''

For a detailed documentation of the availabe plugins
and how they relate to the equations in [Dalitz2013]_, see the Plugins_
documentation.

The best performing features in [Dalitz2013]_ were fdbroken_a_ for shapes
combined from an arbitrary number of parts and fdsingle_complex_position_
for connected shapes consisting of only a single part.

Installation
''''''''''''

This toolkit has only been tested on Linux and MacOS X.
The following installation instructions should work for any Unix like
operating system (MacOS X, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, ...) 

Prerequisites
-------------

First you will need a working installation of Gamera 4.x. See the 
`Gamera website <https://gamera.informatik.hsnr.de/>`__ and the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/hsnr-gamera>` for details. It is strongly recommended that you use
a recent version and install Gamera inside a virtual environment (venv).

If you want to generate the documentation, you will need the additional
third-party Python libraries docutils_ and pygments_ for handling
reStructuredText documents.

.. _docutils: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/
.. _pygments: http://pygments.org/

.. note:: It is generally not necessary to generate the documentation 
   because it is included in file releases of the toolkit.


Building and Installing
-----------------------

To build and install this toolkit on Linux or MacOS X, activate your virtual environment (where Gamera is installed), go to the base
directory of the toolkit distribution and run ::
	
	# 1) activate the virtual environment
	source path/to/venv/bin/activate
   	# 2) compile
	python3 setup.py build bdist_wheel
	# 3) install
	pip3 install dist/gamera_ocr-*.whl
	
No root privileges are required. All components are installed locally inside the virtual environment.

If you want to use your virtual environment with Gamera globally, you can add its bin directory to your shellâ€™s PATH variable:

echo 'export PATH="$HOME/venv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

To regenerate the documentation, go to the ``doc`` directory and run the
``gendoc.py`` script. The output will be placed in the ``doc/html/``
directory.  The contents of this directory can be placed on a webserver
for convenient viewing.

.. note:: Before building the documentation you must install the
   toolkit. Otherwise ``gendoc.py`` will not find the plugin documentation.

Uninstallation
--------------

On Linux, you can uninstall the fd_toolkit as follows:
	1)Activate the virtual environment:
	source venv/bin/activate
	2)Uninstall the toolkit:
	pip3 uninstall fd_toolkit

All python library files of this toolkit are installed into the 
``gamera/toolkits/fd_toolkit`` subdirectory of the Python library folder.
It is thus sufficient to remove this directory for an uninstallation.

Where the python library folder is depends on your system and python version.
Here are the folders that you need to remove on MacOS X and Debian Linux
("2.5" stands for the python version; replace it with your actual version):

  - MacOS X: ``/Library/Python/2.5/gamera/toolkits/fd_toolkit``

  - Debian Linux: ``/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/gamera/toolkits/fd_toolkit``

Recommendation: Always install toolkits using pip inside a virtual environment, so you can uninstall them cleanly.
